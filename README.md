# useContactHooks
This is an example of a custom react hook that I wrote in service of a larger company project.  

This larger project interacted with a service that dealt with "Contacts".

Protobuf definitions were written to define what a "Contact" looked like and what the requests looked like to interact with the "Contact" service.

The types of the requests, searches and the hooks were based off of these protobuf definitions to try and align with the gRPC use cases that were implemented in python.

The folder structure of this example repo is not exactly identical to the larger project and was simplified to remove unnecessary nesting.
